# My Dotfiles
The collection of my precious dotfiles.

## Installation
To install run this command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/saibotk/.dotfiles ~/; cd ~/.dotfiles; ./install
```
This should install all dependencies and create symlinks to all needed files.

## Customization
It is possible to load your own commands you want to execute in the `.zshrc`. To add commands you want to execute on shell startup, just add a `localcommands` file with your commands in `~/.dotfiles/zsh/`.

## Thanks To...

@Jidbo for his dotfiles and nvim configurations.  
And the great macos realted configs and scripts from Dries Vints (@driesvints) which many parts are heavily copied from. See (https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles).
Also thanks to @djfhe for his initial customizations of the macos dotfiles.
